The main premise for this style tile was centered around the website's name: Backyard Art. The overall feeling I was aiming to capture was an earthy, natural, and comforting aesthetic much like what you would experience while being outside in your own backyard. The color palette was chosen to reflect the blues, greens, yellows, and browns that nature provides, yet with a more rustic feel. The font choices were chosen in order to provide a comforting experience for the viewer, yet be bold enough in order to stand out when used on top of images. The mood visuals were selected to reflect the rustic elements and artistic nature behind creating art, such as wooden brushes and the act of getting yourself covered in paint. The sepia filter for non art images on the website was chosen instead of black and white in order to provide a more warm, subdued effect that would still be prominent enough to allow an evident distinction against the real focus of the site: the art. 

## Modern Style Tile

The direction behind this style tile was inspired by the musical group Yeah Yeah Yeah's _It's Blitz!_ album and was geared towards representing the more contemporary side of art. The selection of the mood visuals were intended to resemble the album cover's modern and simplistic image of a hand against a white backdrop, yet still encompass art with the presence of paint on them. The color palette was kept very minimal but bold through the use of mainly black and white with the addition of an eye catching red for hierarchical purposes and to draw attention to the most important text on the page. The fonts chosen were selected for their very clean and modern feel.

## Pop Style Tile

The theme driving this style tile was centered around the idea of how the world is viewed in black and white and art is the splash of color that brings it to life. The typography selection was focused around being fun and playful, yet modern and bold enough to stand out and make a statement. The color palette selected was for the purpose to bring that "pop of color" to a black and white screen, yet be used sparingly as to keep the main focus on the art on the page. The main light blue/
turquoise color was pulled from the given mood visuals which would be used for the background image on the homepage. The photos were taken by photographer Louis Lander Deacon and were chosen not only for their beauty, but mainly for the concept behind them and their relevance to the website name and the style tiles theme: 
* Through the use of animation I'd switch between black and white to colored versions of various images from the
collection to represent the effect art has on the world.
* The images of art occurring outside, like the name of the site infers: Backyard Art.
* The bright and vibrant colors in the photo are against an otherwise dull backdrop and therefore "pop".
