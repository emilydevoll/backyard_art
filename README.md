# Backyard Art
As an artist that loves what I do and wants to share, collaborate, and sell my art as well as be informed of what all 
events and opportunies related to art are occuring around me, I have set out to provide a website for others like me.
That's where Backyard Art comes in. It's a site made by art lovers, for art lovers. Built on “Keeping Austin Local”, 
everything is geared towards buying, selling, and sharing art from your own backyard.

## The Problem
Living in a city that is so encompassed by a passion for music and the arts, you would think there would be an abundance
of websites floating around that are geared towards helping promote, sell, and inform its users of related events 
occuring in our beloved Austin, Tx. When it comes to music, yes, but unless you're associated with an art gallery in town
you are out of luck as an artist. Austin is huge on keeping everything local, but unless you know how to set your
search settings on Etsy to local or are an avid art festival goer, there currently isn't anything available to allow
art enthusiasts and collectors to buy art from local artists in town. Want to know what art events are going on
this week? Or perhaps you're an artist wanting to know the deadlines for all of the art festivals coming up. Regardless, 
have fun googling for every event, festival, or association's website to view their individual calendars to know what's
going on.

## The Solution 
What I've created is a website application that allows Austin artists to create a page that showcases their art alongside
their available means of contact in order to share, sell, promote, and reach out to others interested in buying art or
wanting to collaborate with other artists. The web app also contains an all inclusive events calendar that consists of
everything anyone would need to know when it comes to Austin's art exhibits, festivals, gallery openings, and social
events such as art meetups.

## The Research
The beginnings of my research consist of looking into what related websites were currently out there. Austin does offer
a multitude of websites for current galleries and art associations for their members to showcase their art. I was able
to combine certain potential design elements from 

#### User Interviews
When conducting user interviews, I focused my attention on both potential artist members and those who would be interested
in buying artwork from the site. I asked them various questions, including: what 

#### Calendar
Knowing that one of the main components of my site was going to be calendar that could hold a heavy amount of information
while still being asthetically pleasing (high importance), I spent quite a bit of time researching current options that
are available for embedding on a website. After compiling everything, I found for a more recent website, UpTo, was the
best option for my site. Not only did it allow event image and design customization, but it also allowed for an extension
to a more information page that show

## The Result

#### Design
The design I decided to go with was derived from my "Pop" style guide. It's theme was centered around the idea of how
the world is seen in black and white and art is the splash (or pop) of color that brings it to life. 

Oswald Regular is a bold face sans-serif that was selected for the header/primary fonts due to it's modern appearance and it's 
ability to stand out against a busy background/image. The body/secondary fonts are Poppins Light (with medium used for
words/text needing emphasis) which were selected for their more rounded edges for a more subtle affect against the 
Oswald typeface while still exhibiting a modern feel. 

The light blue/turqoise was pulled from the colored versions of the background images and was chosen as a means to have
a distinct contrast against the rest of the site's black and white demeanor, while still subtle enough to not take away
from the art being presented on the page.

The homepage background images are from photographer Louis Lander-Deacon (known for the Imagine Dragons' _Head Me_ album
cover). They were chosen not only for their beauty, but mainly for the concept behind them and their relevance to the
website name and overall theme trying to be portrayed for the site: 
* Through the use of animation I'd switch between black and white to colored versions of various images from the
collection to represent the effect art has on the world.
* The images of art occurring outside, like the name of the site infers: Backyard Art.


* The bright and vibrant colors in the photo are against an otherwise dull backdrop and therefore "pop".
